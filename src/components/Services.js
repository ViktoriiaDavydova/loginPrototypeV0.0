                        We board friendly and vaccinated dogs in our home with our own dogs and treat them like a 
                        member of the family! That means plenty of potty breaks, play time in our large fenced 
                        in yard, and lots of cuddle time and cookies!  Raw or dehydrated food, medications, 
                        injections and blind or deaf dogs are no worry for us; we are happy to accommodate 
                        them for no additional charge.
